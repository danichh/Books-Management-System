# Books-Management-System
A limited library management software is a small application where the librarian can add a book to the catalog, issue a book, return a book, and view the catalog and the list of issued books. To issue a book to a student, the librarian checks for the student roll number and also check the availability of the requested book. The librarian after checking out the book, updates the books table in the database. Books can be searched using the title, the author name, or the year of publishing
